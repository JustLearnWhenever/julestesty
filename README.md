# Windows DLL Exploitation Game

Welcome to the Windows DLL Exploitation Game! This is a web-based, terminal-style game designed to teach you about various DLL exploitation techniques in a simulated Windows environment.

## How to Play

1.  **Access the Game:** The game is hosted online. You can play it by navigating to: `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/` (Replace placeholders after deployment).
2.  **Interface:** You'll interact with a command-line interface (CLI) directly in your browser.
3.  **Start a Mission:** Type `start_mission <id>` to begin a mission (e.g., `start_mission 1`).
4.  **Get Briefed:** Type `briefing` to understand your current mission objectives.
5.  **Use Commands:** Interact with the simulated environment using commands like:
    *   `help`: Lists available commands.
    *   `scan <ip>`: Scans a target IP for information.
    *   `connect <ip>`: Connects to a target system.
    *   `disconnect`: Disconnects from the current system.
    *   `ls`: Lists files in the current directory of a connected system.
    *   `cd <directory>`: Changes directory on a connected system.
    *   `upload <local_file> <remote_path>`: Simulates uploading a file.
    *   `execute <program_name> [args]`: Simulates executing a program.
    *   `learn <topic>`: Provides educational content about vulnerabilities (e.g., `learn dll hijacking`).
6.  **Achieve Objectives:** Follow the mission briefing to exploit vulnerabilities and achieve your objectives.
7.  **Learn:** After completing a mission or by using the `learn` command, take time to understand the educational content provided about the exploit and its prevention.

## Current Missions

*   **Mission 1: Basic DLL Hijacking:** Learn how applications can insecurely load DLLs and how this can be exploited.
*   **Mission 3: Reflective DLL Injection:** Discover a more advanced technique to inject DLLs into processes stealthily.
