# Game Design: DLL Exploitation Simulator

## 1. Game Concept

*   **Brief Overview:** A web-based Command Line Interface (CLI) game that simulates scenarios involving Windows DLL (Dynamic Link Library) exploitation. Players will learn about common DLL vulnerabilities and attack techniques in a controlled, educational environment.
*   **Player Objective:** To successfully complete a series of missions, each focusing on a different DLL exploitation technique, ultimately gaining a better understanding of how these attacks work and how to defend against them.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

The game will follow a structured loop for each mission:

1.  **Receive Mission Briefing:** Players get context, objectives, and any initial intelligence for the current mission via a `briefing` command.
2.  **Scan Target System:** Players use commands like `scan <ip>` to gather information about the simulated target system, identifying potential vulnerabilities or useful data.
3.  **Prepare Payload/Exploit:** Based on the mission and findings, players will select, modify, or "craft" a DLL (or other tools) necessary for the exploit. This might involve using commands like `upload` to place a malicious DLL.
4.  **Execute Exploit:** Players will use specific commands (e.g., `execute injector.exe <pid> <dll_path>`) to attempt the exploitation.
5.  **Achieve Mission Objective:** Successful exploitation leads to achieving the defined goal (e.g., creating a file, intercepting data).
6.  **Receive Educational Debrief:** After completing the mission, players receive a summary of the vulnerability exploited, how the attack worked, and common defense/mitigation strategies. This information will also be accessible via a `learn` command.

## 3. Progression System

*   **Linear Mission Structure:** Missions will be presented in a specific order, gradually increasing in complexity. Completing one mission unlocks the next.
*   **Tool Unlocks:** New tools, commands, or more potent versions of existing tools might be unlocked as players progress.
*   **Rank/Skill Level (Optional):** A simple "Rank" or "Skill Level" could increase with each successful mission, providing a sense of accomplishment (e.g., Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert).

## 4. Simulated Environment & Tools

The game will simulate a simplified environment with specific commands:

*   **Fake File Systems:** Each target machine will have a mock file system (`C:\Windows\System32\`, `C:\Program Files\TargetApp\`, etc.).
*   **Simulated Network Interactions:** Commands like `connect <ip>` and `scan <ip>` will simulate network activity.
*   **Core Commands:**
    *   `help`: Displays available commands and their usage.
    *   `briefing`: Shows the current mission details.
    *   `scan <ip_address>`: Simulates scanning a target IP for open ports, running services, or known vulnerabilities.
    *   `connect <ip_address>`: Simulates establishing a connection to a target machine.
    *   `disconnect`: Disconnects from the current machine.
    *   `ls [path]`: Lists files and directories in the current or specified path on the simulated remote machine.
    *   `cd <directory>`: Changes the current directory on the simulated remote machine.
    *   `upload <local_file_name> <remote_path>`: Simulates uploading a file (e.g., a malicious DLL) from the player's "toolkit" to the target machine.
    *   `execute <program_name> [args]`: Simulates running an executable on the target machine.
    *   `learn <vulnerability_name>`: Accesses educational content about a specific vulnerability.
*   **Exploit-Specific Tools (Unlocked progressively):**
    *   `injector.exe <pid> <dll_path>`: A tool for basic DLL injection.
    *   `create_proxy_dll <original_dll_name> <output_proxy_dll_name>`: A tool to help craft proxy DLLs.
    *   `reflective_injector.exe <pid> <dll_path>`: A tool for more advanced reflective DLL injection.

## 5. DLL Exploitation Scenarios (Details)

### Mission 1: Basic DLL Hijacking (Beginner)

*   **Target:** A simple program (`TargetApp.exe`) that is known to load `version.dll` without specifying a full path. The application will first look in its own directory.
*   **Player Task:**
    1.  Identify that `TargetApp.exe` loads `version.dll`.
    2.  `upload version.dll C:\Program Files\TargetApp\version.dll` (where `version.dll` is a malicious version provided to the player).
    3.  `execute TargetApp.exe`.
    4.  Success is verified if a file named `hacked.txt` is created in `C:\Program Files\TargetApp\`.
*   **Educational Content:**
    *   Explanation of DLL search order in Windows.
    *   Risks of applications loading DLLs from relative paths or user-writable directories.
    *   Defense: Secure DLL loading practices (e.g., `SetDllDirectory`, manifest files), ensuring applications load DLLs from trusted locations.

### Mission 2: DLL Injection via `CreateRemoteThread` (Beginner)

*   **Target:** A running process (`VictimProcess.exe`) with a known Process ID (PID), e.g., 1234.
*   **Player Task:**
    1.  Obtain or be given `payload.dll` (a DLL that, when loaded, pops a simulated message box or writes to a log).
    2.  Upload `payload.dll` to a location on the target system (e.g., `C:\Windows\Temp\payload.dll`).
    3.  Use the command: `execute injector.exe 1234 C:\Windows\Temp\payload.dll`.
    4.  Success is indicated by a simulated message box appearing or a specific log entry.
*   **Educational Content:**
    *   How `CreateRemoteThread` combined with `LoadLibrary` is a common technique for DLL injection.
    *   How attackers can force a process to load an arbitrary DLL.
    *   Detection: Monitoring for suspicious thread creation in processes, unexpected loaded modules.
    *   Defense: Reducing process privileges, Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), monitoring API calls.

### Mission 3: Reflective DLL Injection (Advanced)

*   **Target:** A process running on a system with stricter module loading policies (e.g., policies that might log or block standard `LoadLibrary` calls from unexpected modules).
*   **Player Task:**
    1.  Obtain or be given `reflective_payload.dll` (a specially crafted DLL that can map itself into memory).
    2.  Upload `reflective_payload.dll` to the target system.
    3.  Use the command: `execute reflective_injector.exe <PID> C:\Path\To\reflective_payload.dll`.
    4.  Success is verified by the payload's effects (e.g., creating a specific file, simulated C2 beacon).
*   **Educational Content:**
    *   Concept of reflective DLL injection: loading a DLL from memory without relying on `LoadLibrary`.
    *   How it can bypass some security measures like module load monitoring based on `LoadLibrary` calls or on-disk DLL scans.
    *   Challenges in detection: requires memory scanning and analysis for unbacked executable regions or unusual patterns.
    *   Defense: Advanced memory analysis tools, behavior-based detection.

### Mission 4: DLL Proxying (Advanced)

*   **Target:** An application (`SecureApp.exe`) that legitimately uses a specific utility DLL, for example, `graphics_utils.dll`, and calls functions from it.
*   **Player Task:**
    1.  Identify `graphics_utils.dll` as a dependency of `SecureApp.exe`.
    2.  Simulate obtaining the original `graphics_utils.dll`.
    3.  Use a tool: `execute create_proxy_dll original_graphics_utils.dll malicious_graphics_utils.dll` (this tool would simulate renaming the original to `original_graphics_utils.dll` and creating a new `graphics_utils.dll` that forwards calls to `original_graphics_utils.dll` while also containing malicious code).
    4.  The malicious code, for instance, logs keystrokes (simulated) to `C:\Windows\Temp\keylogs.txt`.
    5.  Replace the original `graphics_utils.dll` with the player's proxy DLL.
    6.  Run `SecureApp.exe`.
    7.  Success is verified by checking the contents of `keylogs.txt`.
*   **Educational Content:**
    *   How DLL proxying works: intercepting function calls by placing a malicious DLL that mimics a legitimate one.
    *   Legitimate uses (e.g., API hooking for monitoring, extending functionality).
    *   Malicious uses (e.g., persistence, credential theft, man-in-the-middle within a process).
    *   Detection: Verifying digital signatures of DLLs, monitoring for unexpected DLL loads or file modifications, comparing function exports.

## 6. Educational Content Integration

*   **`learn <vulnerability_name>` Command:** After a vulnerability type (e.g., "DLL Hijacking", "Reflective Injection") is introduced or used in a mission, players can type `learn DLL Hijacking` to get detailed information.
*   **Post-Mission Debrief:** A concise summary of the exploited vulnerability, its impact, and key defense strategies will be displayed automatically upon successful mission completion.
*   **Content Focus:**
    *   **Attack Mechanics:** Clear explanation of how the specific DLL exploitation technique works.
    *   **Defense/Mitigation:** Actionable advice and technical measures to prevent or detect such attacks. This includes secure coding practices, OS configurations, and security software capabilities.
